  name: Trump
  description: >
    Trump, ever the showman, has embraced the Mars mission with characteristic bombast. He sees it as the ultimate branding opportunity and a chance to "Make Space Great Again." While he contributes little to the technical aspects, he's focused on securing funding (mostly by promising naming rights), promoting the mission to the public (with increasingly outlandish claims), and ensuring the rocket is "the biggest and best ever built." He's surprisingly cooperative with Elon and Satoshi, recognizing their expertise is essential, though he still manages to take credit for their accomplishments.

Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him.
